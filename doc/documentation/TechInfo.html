<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> This document
will attempt to describe the technology used to solve certain problems
encountered during the testing of distributed applications. The
application Quality Agent Tester (QAT) will be used extensively in this
discussion to illustrate the various points, since it is an
implementation of the technology under patent consideration, as well as
proof the technology is feasible! </span><br

<h2 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> <a
 name="Technology Overview"></a>Technology Overview</h2>
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> Developing test
suites is becoming more and more complex as the need to test on
multiple platforms, multiple architectues, and multiple software
releases increases. </span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Each additional
component increases exponentially the amount of time required to run
each test component on all possible permutations of hardware &amp;
software scenarios being tested. </span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">This technology
attempts to facilitate the distribution of tests by centralising the
tests to a single machine, and distributing the tests to simple agents
running on the target machines to be tested. It also solves the problem
of having to install - reinstall the test machines each time one of the
above variables changes. </span><br

<h2 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> <a
 name="Why was this technology developed?"></a>Why was this technology
developed?</h2>
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> First of all,
lets imagine a theoretical product XFtp. Let us assume the product is a
non-graphical, command-line driven product used for ftp access between
any two machines running the XFtp software. Lets also assume the
marketing department decides to release a Solaris, Windows NT and Win95
version. </span>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">To completely
validate the product, we need to run our test suite on the following
architectures : <br>
Solaris (Intel) <br>
Solaris (Sparc) <br>
Windows NT (Intel) <br>
Windows NT (Alpha) <br>
Windows 95 </p>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Now since our
product is communicating between two machines, we need to confirm it
interoperates between any combination of the above architectures. <br>
So we have the following combinations : <br>

<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">To further
complicate our lives, we assume XFtp is written in Java, so we need to
test it on Java 2 and Java 1.1.8. This nicely increases our test
combinations from 25 to 50. <br>
It soon becomes clear that as new variables are added, the number of
test combinations spirals rapidly out of control. It gets MUCH worse
when you are testing real distributed software running on multiple
machines. We currently run our tests on 16 different machines! (If we
limit ourselves to Solaris Intel and Solaris Sparc, this still gives 20
922 789 888 000 combinations!) Clearly some automation of this process
would be a good idea. </p>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">This is still only
half the problem. Each machine has to be installed with the software to
be tested. With the engineering department sometimes delivering new
versions 2 or three times a week, this also gets to be a very time
consuming process. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h2 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> <a
 name="How does this technology solve these problems?"></a>How does
this technology solve these problems?</h2>
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> The way to solve
the above problems is to abtract the process of running the test on a
machine. So from a testers point of view, there is one test suite,
which we execute, and then get the results for further analysis. The
specifics of the machine on which the test will be run is completely
hidden, and is neccesary for running the test. How do we do this? </span>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Step one is to
write your each test case in a platform independant way. To do this, we
developed a simple scripting language, very similar to C-shell,
although it could be implemented as any language you want. All
references to platform specific items are delayed by referring to one
or more configuration files. A configuration is then built up for each
test based on the architecture and operating system of the target
machine. </p>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">So instead of
directly executing a command within the test, we refer to variables
which will only be defined at the time of running the test. For
example, to start a Java Virtual Machine, instead of using : </p>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><font
 color="#3333ff">execute("c:\jdk1.2\bin\java.exe TestCaseClass")</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">we would use : </p>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><font
 color="#3366ff">JAVA_CMD=JAVA_CMD_AGENTNAME</font> <br>
<font color="#3366ff">execute(JAVA_CMD+"TestCaseClass")</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">In this way, we
don't care at the test level what type of machine the test will run on.
Somewhere higher up in the configuration hierarchy we might have a file
which defines these values as : </p>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><font
 color="#3366ff">IF (AGENT1_OS=="WindowsNT")</font> <br>
<font color="#3366ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
JAVA_CMD_AGENTNAME="c:\jdk1.2\bin\java.exe"</font> <br>
<font color="#3366ff">ELSE</font> <br>
<font color="#3366ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
JAVA_CMD_AGENTNAME="/usr/bin/java"</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The second, and
possible more important step, is to transfer the test to whatever
machine we want to run it on (agent). <br>
This was achieved by developing a relatively stupid agent that can
respond to a limited set of requests from the harness via TCP sockets.
Some examples are GETFILE, SENDFILE, DELFILE, EXECUTE etc. The test
script running on the harness may then use this command set to build up
a desired environment on the agent. We are able to transfer files,
unzip files, delete files, set environment variables, and any of the
other good things we need to run a test. Once the test is run, a result
is decided on, and sent back to the harness for processing. <br>
Since the agent is written in Java, it runs on any architecture
supporting a JVM, included restricted ones running pJava, kJava nad
various other slimmed down versions. </p>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The data flow
outline is presented in Figure 1 : <br>
<img src="images/Architecture.png" height="480" width="640"> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h2 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> <a
 name="Architecture"></a>Architecture</h2>
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> To execute a
properly written set of tests, residing on the harness, all one needs
to do is configure the platform specific elements of each supported
agent machine architecture. These values typically don't change after
initial set up of the system. The harness then allows selection of the
agent permutations, and since the agents can be queried, we can
detectjust prior to running, what the destination machine setup needs
to be, and send the corresponding commands comprising our test case to
this agent. </span><br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">So changing a
test combination from running NT-Solaris to Solaris-Solaris now just
involves clicking on the agents you want to run the test on - the rest
is automatic. </span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Furthermore, the
file transfer facility allows the application which is to be tested, to
be sent to the agent machine as well, meaning you now no longer need to
re-install the agent machine with each new release of software to be
tested. Since the agent-client communication is connectionless, even
rebooting the machine is allowed - as long as your agent automatically
restarts during the bootup process. </span>
<p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Enter the QAT Tool.
It is a test harness which centralises all the tests onto the platform
of your choice(it's 100% Pure Java), and all you need to do is run a
simple agent on your test machine, which listens on a TCP socket for
commands from the Harness. <br>
Tests are written in the form of a specially designed scripting
language, but this may be redefined as per user needs by overriding the
parser interface. <br>
The tests have available to them, a limited, but powerfull set of
commands which may be run on an agent machine, such as sending and
recieveing files, starting, stopping and killing processes etc. All
output of the test running on the agent is stored, and sent back to the
harness if requested. <br>
So all tests, associated files, and other bits and pieces used to run
the suite are stored locally on a single machine, and are sent to the
agent machine as required. <br>
All that is required to run ANY test suite on ANY machine, is a Java
Virtual Machine running the QAT Agent. It is also possible to get the
agent to update itself when new software is available, meaning once a
machine is running the agent, it need never be reconfigured. <br>

<h2 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> <a
 name="System Requirements"></a>System Requirements</h2>
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> The test
scripting language has been named QASH - for details on the syntax and
available commands, see the document </span><a href="QASHSyntax.html"
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">QASH Syntax</a><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">. </span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The harness
provides a class called ParserInterface which allows users to define
their own shell script parser for use with the tool. In other words,
the technology is independant of the actual scripting language used. </span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The QAT tool is
written in 100% pure java. The GUI makes use of the Swing classes, but
the agent does not use any gui controls at all. </span><br
