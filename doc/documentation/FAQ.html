Not necessarily, but it's main feature is being able to run a test on
many different architectures with minimal configuration. For example,
if you follow the Quick Start Guide you will in five minutes, be able
to run the same test on NT, Solaris-Intel or Solaris-Sparc without
modifying the test itself. <br>
Furthermore, no installation of any kind is required, since the test is
itself sent to the machine which is running it. <br>
If your product runs only on one architecture, there are many better
products available for this type of testing. <br>

The test examples provided with the distribution zip file are written
in Java, but they may be written in any binary form you wish. <br>
You are responsible however, for ensuring a binary version exists for
each agent architecture you want to run the test on. For example, if you
wish to run your tests on x86 and Sparc architecture, you will need
provide binary versions of your tests in a format able to run on both
of these architectures.
