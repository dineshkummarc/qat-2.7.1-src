<h3>
<a NAME="System Menu"></a>System Menu</h3>
The system menu allows access to commands for saving, loading and renaming
projects, running tests, printing reports, and showing version information.

<h4>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Run selected tests</b></li>

<br>This will run all tests currently selected in the test tree. If a directory
is selected, but closed (ie no children showing), all the tests contained
in this subdirectory will be run. If a selected directory is open and selected,
only selected tests in this directory will be executed.
<li>
<b>Stop current run</b></li>

<br>This will halt the current test run, or give an error message if no
tests are currently running. The tests currently running may block if it
is waiting for a <b>GETSTATUS</b> command result, when the corresponding
process is blocked and no timeout was set when calling the <b>CMD_START</b>
command.
<li>
<b>Select all tests</b></li>

<br>This will select all the tests in the test tree, expanding all nodes
to make the tests visible as well. Another way to select all the tests
is to make sure the root node is closed and selected, and then select the
"Run selected tests" command.
<li>
<b>Re-parse the tests</b></li>

<br>The test files are parsed by the relevant ParserInterface only when
a new test directory is selected, or project properties which affect the
parsing of tests, has changed. A serialized version og the parsed test
is used to store keyword, name, output etc. information for displaying
in the test tree. Calling the re-parse command will force the GUI to reload
the tests and re-parse in case changes were made to the disk versions.
When a test is run, it always uses the disk version, so re-parsing tests
is only neccesary to reflect changes to GUI visible parameters of a test,
such as available output trace files, include file changes etc.
<li>
<b>Load,, Save, Save project As</b></li>

<br>These methods are responsible for saving and loading the various run
combinations you've set up.
<br>A saved project includes all run results for each test, the parsed
values for each test, the output trace files for each process started by
a test, as well as the parser output for each test.
<li>
<b>Exit</b></li>

<br>This will exit the GUI harness. The current project will be saved automatically.\</ol>

<h4>
Edit</h4>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Edit project</b></li>

<br>This allows access to the project settings. The following values may
be adjusted :

<td>These are any default values which are passed to the Parser when parsing
the test files, and executing the test files.</td>

<tr>
<td>Display output trace files in the test tree</td>

<td>If selected, the viewable stdout and stderr traces for each test will
be visible as child nodes of the test node. If not selected, they may be
viewed via the right click pop-up menu.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Parser class name</td>

<td>For use if a user has defined their own class implementing the ParserInterface</td>

<td>For use if the user has defined their own TestFinderInterface class.</td>

<tr>
<td>Test directory path</td>

<td>The root from which to search for test files.</td>

<tr>
<td>Re-use trace viewer window</td>

<td>If selected, all trace view requests will appear in the same TraceViewer
window. If not selected, a&nbsp; new TraceViewer window will pop-up for
each view requested.</td>
