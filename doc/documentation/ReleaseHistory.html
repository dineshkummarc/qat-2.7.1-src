    <h4>New XML test syntax available</h4>
    <blockquote>There is now a new test syntaxt, QAXML, which will be
the focus for all new QAT development.<br>
Allows much more concise parsing of test files, far less ambiguity etc.
However, is still under development, and I recommend using it in
conjunction with QASH tests. The harness allows QASH and QAXML to exist
in the same workspace, allowing you to migrate only new tests as
neccesary.<br>

  <blockquote>
    <h4> JDK1.3 on linux has a critical bug in Runtime.exec(...)</h4>
    <blockquote>It is currently not possible to retrieve the exit value
of a launched process unless you are in the same Thread as whoever made
a call to exec(), which is not the case for our agent. So we cannot
accurately determine if a process is running, finished etc - should be
fixed in the next release.</blockquote>
    <h4> Native agent multithreading</h4>
    <blockquote>The native agent has trouble running multithreaded on
Chorus and Linux systems, for reasons as yet unknown. Seems to work fine
on Solaris.</blockquote>

  <h3> <a name="Request for enhancement"></a><u>Request for enhancement</u></h3>
  <blockquote>
    <h4> Notepad save/exit check</h4>
    <blockquote>Prompt the user to save a file if it was modified
before allowing an exit of the Notepad editor.</blockquote>
    <h4> Slimming down the agent</h4>
    <blockquote>Plan to provide a smaller separate agent.jar file
containing exclusively the classes required by the Agent, and which runs
on limited VM's such as pJava and kJava if possible. This will be
investigated once their final class structure is known. There will
hopefully be no changes in agent functionality<br>

    </blockquote>
    <h4> Changed all images to .png</h4>
    <blockquote>The GUI now uses only .png images instead of the
mixture of jpg and gif, in solidarity with the opensource boycott of LZW
compression  patent restrictions imposed by UNISYS. This however limits
useage of JDK1.3  and later, since PNG files are not supported in
JDK1.2.x.</blockquote>
    <h4> Improved agent discovery</h4>
    <blockquote>The agents previously all did a multicast reply all at
once, so network flooding may have resulted in some responses being
lost. Now each response is randomly sent within a short time-frame, to
limit the number of responses which might clash.</blockquote>
    <h4> Added parser command trace</h4>
    <blockquote>The command currently being processed by the QASHParser
is now displayed in real time in the QAT status bar. Currently the
information is fairly basic, but may be improved to include more detail
at a later stage.</blockquote>

    <h4> Viewing mixed mode output generates NullPointerException</h4>
    <blockquote>If your some of your trace output is in Html format,
and some in plain text, viewing one after the other used to generate a
Swing NullPointer exception due to a Swing bug.&nbsp; Finally a
workaround has been found.</blockquote>
    <h4> Html Report traces being lost</h4>
    <blockquote>The html report generated files names which were often
longer than 256 characters, and lightweight operating systems like
Solaris can not handle this, so some traces were lost. There is now a
new algorithm for allocating file names, which makes use of the
(hopefully unique) hashcode for each test path.</blockquote>
    <h4> Interrupting runs was a bit buggy</h4>
    <blockquote>Sometimes interrupting a started test run did not
cleanly kill the child processes - hopefully this has now been resolved.
It was caused  by combination of threading issues, as well as the
recently introduced AUTOCLEAN command.</blockquote>
    <h4> Less threads required per execute command</h4>
    <blockquote>Each Exec request previously launched a new Thread. Now
the ExecProcess object re-uses the current Thread context since we know
a new  thread is started to handle each agent request. Need to look out

major renaming to allow new requested functionality to be implemented.
The following  naming changes will need to be made to remove parsing
errors: <br>
TESTPATH -&gt; <b>qat.project.path</b> <br>
AGENT_COUNT - &gt; <b>qat.agent.count</b> <br>
AGENT1_NAME -&gt; <b>agent1.name</b> <br>

        <b>qat.qash.path</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The path to the
root directory of the file currently being parsed.</blockquote>
      <p><br>
Your old project settings will automatically be converted to use the
new naming schema, however you will need to manually change all your
test scripts. As a result of this, versioning has been introduced for
the &lt;project&gt;.prj as well as the &lt;project&gt;.ser files. <br>
The QAT remains backwardly compatible, but deprecation warnings will be
printed if you continue to use the old syntax. Support for the old
syntax will be terminated in version 2.6.5. <br>

GETTRACEPATHS(agent_id, envtrace, stdouttrace, stderrtrace) which allows
you to retrieve the exact paths of the output being generated by a
process started on the agent, and relative to the agent. Please note,
due to this change, you need to use the same version of agent (2.6.x or
higher) to make use of this new command.</blockquote>
    <h4> Commandline interface improved</h4>

renaming changes (see the <a

details).</blockquote>
    <h4> Parser bug</h4>

to an "IF" statement, which caused an OutOfMemory exception, now gives a
useful  error message instead.</blockquote>
    <h4> New project option</h4>

    <blockquote>It is now possible to launch more than one instance of
Qat, each session acting independantly of the others, and each session
will be saved independantly. Running several Qat gui's in the same Java
Virtual Machine allows great savings in memory space when you need to
run several projects simultaneously. Single instance useage should be
unaffected.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <h4> Agent no longer uses home directory for temporary files</h4>
    <blockquote>Before Java 2, there was no facility for creating
temporary files. The File.createTempFile() function is now used if the
agent is launched  with a Java 2 JVM, so it no longer uses ~/.qat/agent
directory to store temporary trace files. Launching the agent with an
earlier version of the JVM will revert to the old behaviour.</blockquote>
    <h4> Html report generator bug</h4>
    <blockquote>The Html report generator was not updated to ignore
Save/Load project options of the Html interface, and it caused you to
load and save  a project each time a report was generated, causing
interesting side-effects.</blockquote>
    <h4> Native agent - many bugs fixed</h4>
    <blockquote>Native agent now uses Standard template library string
classes, and far fewer pointers. Code has been cleaned up significantly.
Runs large  tests suites now with no difficulty, so approaching
stability levels of java agent.</blockquote>

requirements, while keeping the QAT itself as a generic test tool.
Plugins are stored on a per-project basis, and are configured using the
Project Properties edit dialog.</blockquote>
    <h4> Added console connection functionality to the QAT gui</h4>
    <blockquote>The QAT nows allows you to connect to the console of
any defined agent, and monitor in real time all the traces and requests

specified in the Project Properties edit dialog.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>It is now possible to connect to running agents and
recieve their console output, from the QAT GUI. Each session can specify
it's own  unique debug level, and new options have been included in the
edit project  window to fine-tune the console window buffer size and
debug level. Porting  of this functionality to the C++ version of the
agent is underway, and will be very usefull for agents running on
machines with no or limited consoles. <br>
Furthermore, the agents' console output may now be duplicated to
whoever wants to see it, so multiple users may all see and use the same

generation of agents for OS's not currently supported by Java, as well
as for the constraint we have on Chorus, where only one JVM instance may
be run at a time. Slight modification was made to the communication
between the harness and the agent to allow the C++ agent to recieve
Java objects such as Strings, ints etc coming down the line. This means
that QAT and it's agents must all be running V2.5 or later. I'd suggest
upgrading of all your qa_tester.jar archives lying around, else you'll
wonder why your agents have stopped working. The agent source/binary is
not included inthe delivery zip - if anybody wants it, just send me a

allows much more strict syntax control, and better parse speed. This
will be the  basis for a new syntax allowing functions with return
values. <br>
The entire parsing process was rewritten to ensure minimal string
operations so the entire process is now completely Token based, and
where possible, StringBuffer classes were used to minimise memory
requirements of String objects. Error reporting should be slightly more
accurate than previously. <br>
To use the new parser, simply edit the project properties and change "<i>qat.qashparser.QASHParser</i>"
to "<i>qat.qicparser.QICParser"</i>. Change also "<i>qat.qashparser.QASHTestFinder</i>"
to "<i>qat.qicparser.QICTestFinder</i>". <br>
Select OK, and it will reparse all the tests with the new parser. The
parse speed is improved by several orders of magnitude. <br>

needs to be "<i>c:\\tmp</i>" as it is for <i>java.util.Properties</i>

      <h4> Fixed elusive memory leak</h4>
      <blockquote>There was a mysterious memory leak which occurred if
you ran a single test over and over again, but not when running many
tests in a test run. This has been traced, as now corrected, so we
should have no more "Out of memory" errors occurring on the QAT tool.</blockquote>
      <h4> Agent is now completely asynchronous</h4>
      <blockquote>The agent can now handle multiple requests
simultaneously from several harnesses. Each request from the harness is
handled in a new thread context. It allows blocked processes to be
killed a lot easier, and improves the buggy behavior of stopping a
running test. This was also achieved by changing some synchronous
methods to asynchronous on the QAT harness side.</blockquote>

this option has been removed. This has the added benefit of simplifying
much of the code, and reducing memory overhead due to fewer needed
icons.</blockquote>

      <h4> Printing caused ClassCastException</h4>
      <blockquote>Was calling getAllNodes instead of getAllTestNodes to
retrieve tree nodes for printing.</blockquote>
      <h4> Stopping a test run left the node in "running" state</h4>
      <blockquote>The node is now returned to an UNRESOLVED state if it
is interrupted.</blockquote>
      <h4> Memory leakage problems</h4>
      <blockquote>A memory leakage problem was caused by a swing bug
workaround, and made really bad by the new active viewers attached to
all the test tree nodes. This problem has been fixed, and memory useage
seems stable at about 60MB - still a lot, but it seems to be a Swing
problem, not QAT problem.</blockquote>
      <h4> "localhost" replaced by actual host name</h4>
      <blockquote>Adding an agent defaulted the agent name to
"localhost", but this only has meaning on the harness machine. Lots of
the test scripts  use this value to sent to the agent machines etc, so
now the actual hostname  is supplied by deefault.</blockquote>
      <h4> CMDSTOP syntax handling differed slightly from CMDSTATUS</h4>

CMDSTATUS command, but rejected by the CMDSTOP command. They now exhibit

feature is pretty ugly right now, but is functional. It might be
expanded a little  more if the functionality proves to be usefull.</blockquote>
      <h4> Test Node updated after a test run</h4>
      <blockquote>Previously, a test was only visually updated during a
test re-parse, or from the initial test parse. Now the node is updated
after each test run to reflect any dynamic keyword, testname, include
file and command status changes that may have occurred. The disadvantage
of this approach is that a serious test failure early on might cause
some problems such as undefined test name etc.</blockquote>

    <h4> QASH Properties cacheing side-effect</h4>
    <blockquote>Previously properties files which were included were
cached in memory, so they were only loaded once during the lifetime of
the QASHParser  object. The problem is if you edit a properties file,
this changed will never be reflected until you relaunch the JVM to
create a new QASHParser object, since it will always use the static one
in memory. Now the cache list is refreshed for every QASH file parsed,
which should fix the behaviour. Slight performance loss will result from
having to read a properties file each time between succesive QASH
parses.</blockquote>
